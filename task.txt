program: (7) Documentation
Write a program to analyze the code in Pascal. The input ﬁle is the program *.c. The program prints
to the output ﬁle all the constants and variables, functions, and procedures. These elements are written
out in alphabetical order.

Sample action:

The input ﬁle:

#define CONSTANT 1034 
#define MAX 5 
int index, result;
char string;
void wz(int a, int b)
{
	char variable;
	...
}
void pp(char* name, int how_many)
{
	int counter;
	...
}
int main()
{
	return 0;
}

The output ﬁle:

constants:
CONSTANT
MAX
variables:
index: integer;
string: char;
result: integer;
types are not defined
functions are not defined
procedure:
void pp(char* name, int how_many)
lack of constans
variables:
counter: integer;
types are not defined
void wz(int a, int b)
lack of constants
variables:
variable: char;
types are not defined

The program is run from the command line using the following switches (switches the order is arbitrary):-i input ﬁle with source code
-o output ﬁle with description
